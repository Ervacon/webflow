				This sample application demonstrates the use of the SimpleFormAction: a multi-action
				that allows you to mimic the exact behaviour of the SimpleFormController in a flow.
				It also shows you how to use a multi-action to group all actions executed by a flow
				in single class! Finally, the sample also uses JSTL in conjunction with flows.
